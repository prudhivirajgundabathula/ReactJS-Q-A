differences between DOM and virtual DOM ? Advantages of virtual DOM over DOM
Sure! Let's break down the differences between the DOM and the Virtual DOM, as well as the advantages of using the Virtual DOM over the traditional DOM.
DOM (Document Object Model) : What is the DOM? The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a hierarchical tree structure, where each node is an object representing a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text).
Characteristics of the DOM:
Direct Manipulation: Changes to the DOM are immediately reflected in the browser.
Performance Impact: Direct manipulation of the DOM can be slow and costly, especially when dealing with large or complex documents.
Synchronous Updates: Changes to the DOM can cause synchronous reflows and repaints, affecting the performance and user experience.
Virtual DOM : What is the Virtual DOM? The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is used by libraries like React to manage and update the UI efficiently. The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.
Characteristics of the Virtual DOM:
Efficient Updates: The Virtual DOM allows for efficient updates by comparing the current version with the previous version and identifying the minimal set of changes needed.
Batch Updates: Changes to the Virtual DOM are batched and then applied to the real DOM in a single operation, minimizing performance impact.
Asynchronous Updates: Updates to the real DOM are performed asynchronously, reducing the risk of blocking the main thread.
Advantages of Virtual DOM over DOM
Performance:
The Virtual DOM reduces the performance impact of direct DOM manipulation by batching updates and applying them efficiently.
The diffing algorithm identifies the minimal set of changes needed, reducing the number of operations on the real DOM.
Efficiency:
With the Virtual DOM, only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
This selective updating ensures a smoother and faster user experience.
Consistency:
The Virtual DOM provides a consistent and predictable way to manage updates, reducing the risk of bugs and errors.
It ensures that the UI stays in sync with the application's state, improving reliability.
Developer Productivity:
The Virtual DOM abstracts away the complexities of direct DOM manipulation, allowing developers to focus on building the application logic.
It simplifies the development process by providing a more intuitive and declarative way to describe the UI.
Summary
DOM: Represents the page as a hierarchical tree structure, allowing direct manipulation of the document.
Virtual DOM: A lightweight, in-memory representation of the DOM that enables efficient and performant updates through batching and asynchronous operations.
Overall, the Virtual DOM enhances performance, efficiency, and developer productivity, making it a key feature in modern UI libraries like React.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
give me more about reactjs ? Virtual DOM ? how it was designed and developed ? on what algorithm react js was designed and developed ?
Sure! Let's dive deeper into ReactJS, its Virtual DOM, and the algorithm behind it.
ReactJS and Virtual DOM : ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. One of its key features is the Virtual DOM, which significantly enhances the performance of web applications.
What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. Instead of interacting directly with the real DOM, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance, React creates a virtual representation of the UI components. This virtual representation is a lightweight JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.
How the Virtual DOM Works
Initial Rendering: When the app starts, the entire UI is represented as a Virtual DOM. React elements are created and rendered into the virtual structure.
State and Props Changes: As the states and props change in the app, React re-renders the affected components in the Virtual DOM. These changes do not immediately impact the real DOM.
Comparison Using Diff Algorithm: React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the current version of the Virtual DOM with the previous version. This process identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two versions.
Reconciliation Process: Based on the differences identified, React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM. Only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This selective updating is quick and performant.
Update to the Real DOM: Finally, React applies the necessary changes to the real DOM. This might involve adding, removing, or updating elements based on the differences detected.
Algorithm Behind ReactJS
React's reconciliation algorithm, also known as the diffing algorithm, is designed to efficiently update the UI by minimizing the number of operations required to transform one tree of elements into another.
Key Concepts of the Diffing Algorithm
Elements of Different Types: Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. This ensures that the UI is accurately updated.
DOM Elements of the Same Type: When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes.
Component Instances: React uses a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.
These assumptions help React efficiently update the UI while maintaining high performance.
Design and Development of ReactJS : ReactJS was designed and developed by Facebook to address the challenges of building complex and dynamic user interfaces. The key goals were to improve performance, enhance developer productivity, and create a more maintainable codebase. The introduction of the Virtual DOM and the reconciliation algorithm were pivotal in achieving these goals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
React - What is Diffing Algorithm?
Diffing Algorithm in React JS differentiates the updated and previous DOM of the application. DOM stores the components of a website in a tree structure. React uses virtual DOM which is a lightweight version of the DOM. The only difference is the ability to write the screen like the real DOM, in fact, a new virtual DOM is created after every re-render.

Why is the Diffing Algorithm Important?
Manipulating the DOM is one of the most performance-intensive operations in web development. Updating the entire DOM every time there’s a change would significantly slow down applications. The diffing algorithm ensures that only the minimum required updates are made, leading to:

Improved performance: By limiting DOM manipulations, the application runs faster.
Smooth user experience: Users experience fewer lags, even in dynamic applications.
Optimized rendering: React can handle frequent updates in real-time without performance bottlenecks.
How Diffing Algorithm Works?
First, the content is rendered on the webpage and the DOM tree is created.
On change in any content due to user interaction or change in data from API, React works on observable patterns, hence, whenever there is a change in the state, it updates the nodes in the virtual DOM
In reconciliation the old tree is compared to the newest version to determine the number of changes needed for updation.
After determining the changes a set of optimized and minimal instruction is created to implement on the real DOM.
These changes are then implemented and only content that changed is re-rendered on the web pages.
Assumption for Diffing Algorithm
React uses a heuristic algorithm called the Diffing algorithm for reconciliation based on these assumptions:

Elements of different types will produce different trees
We can set which elements are static and do not need to be checked.
React checks the root elements for changes and the updates depend on the types of the root elements,

Element in different types: Whenever the type of the element changes in the root, react will scrap the old tree and build a new one i.e a full rebuild of the tree.
Elements of the same type: When the type of changed element is the same, React then checks for attributes of both versions and then only updates the node which has changes without any changes in the tree. The component will be updated in the next lifecycle call.

Note: This is the reason why we should always use unique keys in the elements so that it will be easy for React to determine changes in the elements.

Advantages of Diffing Algorithm
It enables efficient updates and reduce the work need to reflect the changes
It enhances the performance by updating only the required components/ nodes.
Results in faster response while change by reducing the unwanted and unnecessary re-renderings.
Limitations of the Diffing Algorithm
While the diffing algorithm is highly efficient, there are some cases where improper use can lead to performance issues

Missing or duplicate keys: Not providing unique keys for list items can result in unnecessary re-renders.
Complex nested structures: In deeply nested components, the diffing process may take longer, although it is still optimized compared to manual DOM manipulation.

ReactJS State
Last Updated : 12 Apr, 2025
In React, the state refers to an object that holds information about a component's current situation. This information can change over time, typically as a result of user actions or data fetching, and when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated UI.

Whenever state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data. This enables you to build dynamic UIs that respond to user interactions.

Syntax

const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
In this syntax

state: The current state value.
setState: A function that is used to update the state.
initialState: The initial value that the state will hold when the component is first rendered.
Creating State Object
Creating a state in React is essential to building dynamic and interactive components. We can create a state object within the constructor of the class component.


import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            brand: 'Ford', // Example property in the state
        };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>My Car</h1>
                {/* Other component content */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default MyComponent;
The MyComponent class extends React.Component, and inside the constructor, it initializes the component's state with a brand property set to 'Ford'.
The render() method returns JSX that displays an <h1> heading with the text "My Car" and renders the component's content.
Updating State in React
We are using the ES6 thick arrow function format to take the previous state and props of the component as parameters and are updating the counter. The same can be written using the default functional way as follows.  


// Filename - index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            count: 0,
        };
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
            count: prevState.count + 1,
        }));
    };

    decrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
            count: prevState.count - 1,
        }));
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>
                    The current count is :{" "}
                    {this.state.count}
                </h1>
                <button onClick={this.increment}>
                    Increase
                </button>
                <button onClick={this.decrement}>
                    Decrease
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById("root")
);
root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
Output


ReactJS State

Key Features of State in React
Encapsulation of Data: Each React component has its own state, and the state data is encapsulated within the component. This means that state is not shared across components unless explicitly passed via props.
Reactivity and Re-rendering: When state changes, React automatically triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state in the UI. React ensures that only the parts of the UI that depend on the state are re-rendered, improving performance.
Mutable Within the Component: State is mutable, meaning you can change it using the setState() method (in class components) or the state-updating function returned by useState() (in functional components). However, you should not directly mutate the state (e.g., this.state.count = 5), as this can lead to unexpected behavior.
Best Practices for Managing State in React
Do Not Directly Modify State: Avoid directly modifying the state. Instead, use setState() or the state-updating function from useState() to ensure proper reactivity.
Use Functional Updates for Previous State: If the new state depends on the previous state, use a functional update to avoid potential issues with state changes.
Lift State Up When Necessary: In React, state should be lifted up to the nearest common ancestor if two components need to share the same state. This makes it easier to manage state at a higher level and pass it down via props.
Use Multiple State Variables: You don’t have to store all your state in a single object. React allows you to use multiple useState() calls in a single component. This can improve readability and maintainability by keeping state values grouped logically.
State vs Props
While both state and props store data in React, they serve different purposes:

State: Managed within the component, mutable, and used to store dynamic data that changes over time.
Props: Passed from a parent component to a child component, immutable, and used to share data between components.
State can change over time and cause re-renders, whereas props are used to pass data from one component to another but are not directly modified by the component receiving them.

When to Use State in React
You should use state in React whenever:

You need to store dynamic data that changes over time.
The component should re-render when the state changes, reflecting updates in the UI.
You need to manage user input, form data, or API responses.
However, if the data does not change over time, it should be handled via props instead of state.

Conclusion
State is an essential concept in React that allows components to maintain dynamic data and re-render themselves when necessary. Whether you're using class components with this.setState() or functional components with the useState() hook, managing state effectively is key to building interactive React applications.

Implementing State in React Components
Last Updated : 11 Jul, 2025
In React State is an object that holds some information which can be changed overtime. Whenever a State is updated it triggers re-rendering of the component. In React components State can be implemented by default in class components and in functional components we have to implement state using hooks.

Approaches To Implementing State in React
Implementing State Using this.state object
Implementing State using useState hook:
Conclusion:
Approaches To Implementing State in React
There are two ways to implement state in React Components based upon the type of component

Using the this.state object (Class Component)
Using the useState hook (Functional Components)
Implementing State Using this.state object
Create a class component by extending Component class
Inside the constructor call the parent constructor using super() method
Initialize state using the this.state object
Pass the values in key-value pair
You can update this state using the this.setState method
To access the state we use JSX syntax and access its value
Implement State using this.state Example :
This example creates a counter in react by implementing state using the above mentioned approach


import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {
            count: 0,
        };
        this.increase = this.increase.bind(this);
    }

    increase() {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ margin: "50px" }}>
                <h1>Welcome to Geeks for Geeks </h1>
                <h3>Counter App using Class Component : </h3>
                <h2> {this.state.count}</h2>
                <button onClick={this.increase}> Add</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
Output:

gfg

Implementing State using useState hook:
Import the useState hook from react
Create a functional component
Create a state object using useState hook
The second parameter in useState hook is used to update the state
The state can be accessed using the JSX syntax
Implement state using react hooks Example:
This example creates a counter by implementing state using the above mentioned approach


import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increase = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div style={{ margin: '50px' }}>
            <h1>Welcome to Geeks for Geeks </h1>
            <h3>Counter App using Functional Component : </h3>
            <h2>{count}</h2>
            <button onClick={increase}>Add</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App;
Output:


Conclusion:
States can be implemented in React by both functional and class components but to implement state in functional component we have to import the useState hook but state can be implemented directly in class component using the this.state object. States are useful as they are mutable unlike props and can helps us to create dynamic and interactive interfaces

ReactJS State vs Props
Last Updated : 03 Jun, 2025
In React, State allows components to manage and update internal data dynamically, while Props enables data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. Understanding their differences and use cases is essential for developing efficient React applications.

State in React
State is a built-in object in React components that holds data or information about the component. It is mutable, which means it can be updated within the component using the setState method in class components or the useState hook in functional components.

State is local to the component and cannot be accessed by child components unless passed down as props.
It is mutable, meaning it can change over time based on user interactions or API responses.
When state updates, the component re-renders to reflect the changes.
Managed using useState in functional components or this.setState in class components.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
Output

count
State in React
In this example

useState(0) initializes the state variable count with the value 0.
The setCount function is used to update the state whenever the button is clicked. This triggers a re-render, updating the displayed count.
Props in React
Props (short for Properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Unlike state, props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified within the receiving component.

Props allow components to be reusable and dynamic.
Props are read-only and cannot be changed by the child component.
They help in data communication between components.
Passed as attributes in JSX elements.

import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return <Greeting name="Jiya" />;
}

export default App;
Output

In React, state and props are both ways to manage data in components—but they serve different purposes and behave differently. Here's a clear breakdown:

🧠 State
- Definition: Internal data managed by the component itself
- Mutable: Can be changed using setState or hooks like useState
- Scope: Local to the component
- Purpose: Tracks dynamic data like user input, toggles, or API responses
- Triggers re-render: Yes, when updated

📦 Props
- Definition: External data passed from parent to child component
- Immutable: Cannot be changed by the receiving component
- Scope: Controlled by the parent component
- Purpose: Used to configure or customize child components
- Triggers re-render: Yes, if parent updates the prop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In React, the children prop is a special built-in prop that allows components to receive and render content nested between their opening and closing tags. It’s a powerful tool for component composition and layout flexibility.

📦 What Is props.children?
When you write:
<MyComponent>
  <p>This is a child element</p>
</MyComponent>


The <p> tag becomes part of props.children inside MyComponent. You can then render it like:
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
};


🧠 Why Use children?
- Component Composition: Build reusable wrappers like modals, cards, or layout containers.
- Flexibility: Accept any JSX—text, elements, or even other components.
- Cleaner Syntax: Avoid passing content as separate props.

🔍 What Can children Be?
It can be:
- A single element
- Multiple elements
- Text, numbers, booleans (ignored in rendering)
- null or undefined (also ignored)
- An array of any of the above

🛠️ Useful React Utilities
React provides methods to work with children safely:
| Method | Purpose | 
| React.Children.map | Transform each child | 
| React.Children.forEach | Run logic for each child | 
| React.Children.count | Count number of children | 
| React.Children.only | Ensure only one child is passed | 
| React.Children.toArray | Flatten children into an array | 

Here's a simple React example that shows how the children prop works:
🧪 Example: Card Component Using props.children
// Card.js
const Card = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '16px', borderRadius: '8px' }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Card;


// App.js
import Card from './Card';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h2>Hello, Prudhivi!</h2>
        <p>This content is passed as children to the Card component.</p>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}


🧠 What’s Happening Here?
- The Card component doesn’t know what content it will receive.
- Whatever is placed between <Card> ... </Card> in App.js becomes props.children.
- This makes Card reusable for wrapping any content.

ReactJS Components Complete Reference

In ReactJS, components are the building blocks that help you create interactive UIs by dividing your app into smaller, reusable pieces of code. Understanding how components work is essential for efficiently developing React applications.

In this article will provide a complete reference to React components, covering their types, usage, and key differences between class and functional components.

What are ReactJS Components?
Components in React are JavaScript functions or classes that return a piece of UI. These components allow developers to build complex UIs from small, isolated, and reusable pieces. React components are the core building blocks for any React application and can manage their state, handle user inputs, and render dynamic content.

Types of React Components
There are two main types of components in React:

Functional Components
Class Components
Functional Components
A Functional Component is a simpler and more concise way of writing components in React using JavaScript functions. These components receive props (properties) as an argument and return JSX (JavaScript XML) to define the UI structure.


import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Welcome = () => {

    const [message, setMessage] = useState("Hello, World!");

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{message}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setMessage("Hello, React!")}>
                Change Message
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Welcome;
Output

functional-component
Functional Components
 In this code

useState is used to manage the message state, initially set to "Hello, World!".
The button click triggers setMessage, which updates the message state to "Hello, React!".
The component displays the message in an <h1> element and updates it when the button is clicked.
Class Components
Class components in React are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They are used for creating components that need to have their own state or lifecycle methods. While functional components are now the go-to choice for many developers (especially with the introduction of hooks like useState and useEffect), class components still have their place and provide a more traditional way of handling component logic in React.


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            count: 0
        };
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    };

    decrement = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Counter: {this.state.count}</h1>
                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Counter;
Output

class-component
Class Components in React
In this code

state: The counter (count) is initialized to 0 in the constructor.
increment and decrement: These methods update the count state by 1 when the respective buttons are clicked.
render: Displays the current count and two buttons to increment or decrement the counter.

ReactJS Functional Components
Last Updated : 17 Feb, 2025
In ReactJS, functional components are a core part of building user interfaces. They are simple, lightweight, and powerful tools for rendering UI and handling logic. Functional components can accept props as input and return JSX that describes what the component should render.

What are Reactjs Functional Components
ReactJS functional components are JavaScript functions that return a JSX element, which is a template used to define the component's structure. JSX looks similar to HTML, but it has a special syntax that lets it be converted into JavaScript code.

Stateless (before hooks): Originally, functional components were stateless and used only for rendering UI based on props.
Simpler Syntax: They are defined as JavaScript functions, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
Return JSX: Functional components return JSX (a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code inside JavaScript).
No, this keyword: Unlike class components, functional components do not have a this context.
Hooks: With hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects, making them just as powerful as class components.

import React from 'react';

const MyComp = (props) => {
    return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
};

export default MyComp;
In the example above:

MyComp is a functional component that takes props as an argument.
It returns a JSX element (<div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>), which will be rendered to the screen.
How ReactJS Functional Components Work
When a functional component receives input and is rendered, React uses props and updates the virtual DOM to ensure the UI reflects the current state.

Here's a breakdown of how this process works:

Props: Functional components receive input data through props, which are objects containing key-value pairs.
Processing Props: After receiving props, the component processes them and returns a JSX element that defines the component's structure and content.
Virtual DOM: When the component is rendered, React creates a virtual DOM tree that represents the current state of the application.
Re-rendering: If the component's props or state change, React updates the virtual DOM tree accordingly and triggers the component to re-render.
Implementation of functional component in ReactJS :


import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Hello World!");

  const changeMessage = () => {
    setMessage("Welcome to React!");
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "50px" }}>
      <h1>{message}</h1>  {/* Display the dynamic message */}
      <button 
        onClick={changeMessage} 
        style={{
          padding: "10px 20px", 
          fontSize: "16px", 
          backgroundColor: "#4CAF50", 
          color: "white", 
          border: "none", 
          borderRadius: "5px", 
          cursor: "pointer"
        }}
      >
        Click Me!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Output

functional : Why use ReactJS Functional Components
ReactJS functional components offer several benefits over class components, including:

Simplicity: Functional components are simpler and easier to read than class components, making them ideal for small to medium-sized projects.
Performance: Functional components are faster than class components because they don’t use the this keyword, which can slow down rendering.
Testability: Functional components are easier to test because they are stateless and don’t rely on lifecycle methods.
Reusability: Functional components can be reused across multiple projects, making them a great choice for building component libraries.
When to Use ReactJS Functional Components
Functional components should be used whenever possible because they are simpler, easier to test, and more performant than class components. However, there are a few cases where functional components may not be suitable:

Stateful components: Functional components cannot hold state on their own. Therefore, if you need to maintain state within your component, you may need to use a class component.
Lifecycle methods: If you need to use lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, or componentWillUnmount, you will need to use a class component.
How to Pass Props to a ReactJS Functional Component
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and allow you to make a component dynamic by passing different values into it.

Passing a Single Prop to a React Functional Component:


import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './components/Greeting';  

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "50px" }}>
      <Greeting message="Hello, World!" />  {/* Passing 'message' prop */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Output

Hello World!
In this code

In the App.js component, we are passing a name prop to the Greeting component.
In Greeting.js, the name prop is accessed using props.name, and it is used to dynamically display the greeting message.
When you render <Greeting name="John" />.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Input Element : In React, the Input Element value can be handled in two ways:
Controlled Input
Uncontrolled Input
1. Controlled Input
If the Input Element value is handled by a React State then it is called Controlled Input. Controlled Inputs are the React Suggested way to handle Input Element value.

Example:
import {Component} from 'react'

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    searchInput: '',
  }

  onChangeSearchInput = event => {
    this.setState({
      searchInput: event.target.value,
    })
  }

  render() {
    const {searchInput} = this.state
    return (
      <input
        type="text"
        onChange={this.onChangeSearchInput}
        value={searchInput}
      />
    )
  }
}

export default App

2. Uncontrolled Input : If the Input Element value is handled by the browser itself then it is called Uncontrolled Input.
Uncontrolled inputs are like traditional HTML form inputs. Its value can only be set by a user, but not programmatically. However, in controlled input value is programmatically handled using React State.
Example:  <input type="text" />

ReactJS Higher-Order Components
Higher-order components (HOC) are an advanced technique in React that is used for reusing component logic. It is the function that takes the original component and returns the new enhanced component.
It doesn’t modify the input component directly. Instead, they return a new component with enhanced behavior.
They allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components without duplicating it.
They are pure functions that accept a component and return a new component.
What Is a Higher-Order Component?
A HOC is a function that:
- Takes a component as input
- Returns a new component with enhanced behavior
const withExtraProps = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} extra="Hello from HOC!" />;
  };
};

📦 Why Use HOCs?
- Code Reusability: Share logic like authentication, logging, or data fetching
- Separation of Concerns: Keep UI and logic separate
- Composition: Combine multiple behaviors without modifying the original component

🛠️ Real Example: Add Logging to Any Component
const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`${WrappedComponent.name} mounted`);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};


Usage:
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello!</div>;
const MyComponentWithLogger = withLogger(MyComponent);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
React Lifecycle
In React, the lifecycle refers to the various stages a component goes through. These stages allow developers to run specific code at key moments, such as when the component is created, updated, or removed. By understanding the React lifecycle, you can better manage resources, side effects, and performance.

What is the React Lifecycle?
The React lifecycle refers to the different phases a component goes through during its time in a React application. These phases allow you to run specific code at key moments in a component's life, such as when it’s created, updated, or removed from the screen.

Here are the three main phases of the React component lifecycle

React-Lifecycle
React Lifecycle Method
Mounting: Initializes, renders, and mounts the component (componentDidMount()).
Updating: Handles state/prop changes, re-renders, and updates (componentDidUpdate()).
Unmounting: Cleans up before removal (componentWillUnmount()).
Phases of Lifecycle in React Components

1. Mounting
Mounting refers to the process of creating and inserting a component into the DOM for the first time in a React application. During mounting, React initializes the component, sets up its internal state (if any), and inserts it into the DOM.

constructor
getDerivedStateFromProps
render()
componentDidMount()

constructor() : Method to initialize state and bind methods. Executed before the component is mounted.

constructor(props) {
    super(props); // Always call super(props) before using this.props
    this.state = {
        count: 0, // Initial state
    };
    console.log("Constructor called");
}

getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) : Used for updating the state based on props. Executed before every render.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    if (props.value !== state.value) {
        return { value: props.value }; // Update state based on new props
    }
    return null; // No changes to state
}

render() method : Responsible for rendering JSX and updating the DOM.

render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello, React Lifecycle!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
componentDidMount() Function : This function is invoked right after the component is mounted on the DOM, i.e. this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed for the first time.

componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component has been mounted");

    // Example: Fetch data from an API
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
}

2. Updation : Updating refers to the process of a component being re-rendered due to changes in its state or props. This phase occurs whenever a component's internal state is modified or its parent component passes new props. When an update happens, React re-renders the component to reflect the changes and ensures that the DOM is updated accordingly.

getDerivedStateFromProps
setState() Function
shouldComponentUpdate()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() Method
componentDidUpdate()
getDerivedStateFromProps

getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) is a static method that is called just before the render() method in both the mounting and updating phase in React. It takes updated props and the current state as arguments.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    if (props.name !== state.name) {
        return { name: props.name }; // Update state with new props
    }
    return null; // No state change
}
setState()
This is not particularly a Lifecycle function and can be invoked explicitly at any instant. This function is used to update the state of a component. You may refer to this article for detailed information.

this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
      counter: prevState.count + props.diff
}));
shouldComponentUpdate()
shouldComponentUpdate() Is a lifecycle method in React class components that determines whether a component should re-render. It compares the current and next props/states and returns true if the component should update or false if it should not.

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
It returns true or false, if false, then render(), componentWillUpdate(), and componentDidUpdate() method does not get invoked.

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() Method
The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is invoked just before the DOM is being rendered. It is used to store the previous values of the state after the DOM is updated.

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
componentDidUpdate()
Similarly, this function is invoked after the component is rendered, i.e., this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed after the updation of State or Props.

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
3. Unmounting
This is the final phase of the lifecycle of the component, which is the phase of unmounting the component from the DOM. The following function is the sole member of this phase.

componentWillUnmount()
This function is invoked before the component is finally unmounted from the DOM, i.e., this function gets invoked once before the component is removed from the page, and this denotes the end of the lifecycle.

Implementing the Component Lifecycle methods
Let us now see one final example to finish the article while revising what’s discussed above.

First, create a react app and edit your index.js file from the src folder.

// Filename - src/index.js:
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
class Test extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hello: "World!" };
    }
    componentDidMount() {
        console.log("componentDidMount()");
    }
    changeState() {
        this.setState({ hello: "Geek!" });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>
                    GeeksForGeeks.org, Hello
                    {this.state.hello}
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    <a
                        onClick={this.changeState.bind(
                            this
                        )}
                    >
                        Press Here!
                    </a>
                </h2>
            </div>
        );
    }
    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
        console.log("shouldComponentUpdate()");
        return true;
    }
    componentDidUpdate() {
        console.log("componentDidUpdate()");
    }
}
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById("root")
);
root.render(<Test />);
Output

React lifecycle example - output

In this example

The Test class is a React component with a state property hello initially set to “World!”.
The componentDidMount() the method runs after the component is added to the DOM, logging “componentDidMount().”
The changeState() method updates the state to change hello to “Geek!” when called.
In the render() method, the component displays the hello state inside an <h1> tag and includes a link to trigger the changeState() function.
The shouldComponentUpdate() method logs “shouldComponentUpdate()” and allows the component to re-render while componentDidUpdate() logs “componentDidUpdate()” after the update.

What is the need for the react lifecycle?
It provides a structured way to handle specific tasks at various points in a component’s life, such as when it is created, updated, or destroyed.

Data Fetching: Lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate() allow you to fetch data, subscribe to services, or update external resources at the appropriate time.
Performance Optimization: By controlling when certain actions occur (e.g., using shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent unnecessary re-renders), you can optimize performance and ensure your app runs efficiently.
Resource Management: The lifecycle helps with cleanup tasks, such as removing event listeners, canceling network requests, or clearing timers (using methods like componentWillUnmount()) to prevent memory leaks.
Handling State and Props Changes: The lifecycle provides hooks to update and respond to state or props changes in a controlled way, allowing for dynamic behavior and interaction in your components.
Handling Component Removal: When a component is no longer needed, the lifecycle helps you clean up resources and ensure that nothing unnecessary continues to run.
React lifecycle method in class component vs functional component
In class components, we need different methods for handling state and side effects, which can be more complex.
In functional components, hooks like useState() and useEffect() make it easier to manage state and side effects, making the code shorter and simpler. Functional components are often preferred because they're cleaner and easier to understand.

Conclusion
The React component lifecycle is essential for managing component behavior, handling state and props, and optimizing performance. By effectively utilizing lifecycle methods, developers can ensure efficient rendering and proper resource management throughout the component’s life.

actJS, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a design pattern that lets you reuse component logic by wrapping one component inside another. It’s not a feature of React itself, but a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

🧠 What Is a Higher-Order Component?
A HOC is a function that:
- Takes a component as input
- Returns a new component with enhanced behavior
const withExtraProps = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} extra="Hello from HOC!" />;
  };
};


📦 Why Use HOCs?
- Code Reusability: Share logic like authentication, logging, or data fetching
- Separation of Concerns: Keep UI and logic separate
- Composition: Combine multiple behaviors without modifying the original component

🛠️ Real Example: Add Logging to Any Component
const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`${WrappedComponent.name} mounted`);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};


Usage:
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello!</div>;
const MyComponentWithLogger = withLogger(MyComponent);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReactJS Fragments are a handy way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This keeps your markup clean and avoids unnecessary <div> wrappers that can clutter your layout or break semantic HTML.
0
🧩 Why Use Fragments?
- Cleaner DOM: No extra wrapper elements
- Better performance: Fewer nodes to render
- Semantic HTML: Avoids invalid nesting (e.g., <td> inside <div>)

🛠️ Two Ways to Use Fragments
1. Shorthand Syntax
<>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>Welcome to React!</p>
</>


2. Explicit React.Fragment
import React from 'react';

<React.Fragment>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>Welcome to React!</p>
</React.Fragment>

Use the explicit form when you need to pass a key prop—like when rendering a list.

🔍 Example: Rendering a List Without Extra <div>s
const FruitList = ({ fruits }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <React.Fragment key={index}>
          <h3>{fruit.name}</h3>
          <p>{fruit.description}</p>
        </React.Fragment>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

This avoids wrapping each fruit in a <div>, keeping your DOM lean and mean.
