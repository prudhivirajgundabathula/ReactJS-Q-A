differences between DOM and virtual DOM ? Advantages of virtual DOM over DOM
Sure! Let's break down the differences between the DOM and the Virtual DOM, as well as the advantages of using the Virtual DOM over the traditional DOM.
DOM (Document Object Model) : What is the DOM? The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a hierarchical tree structure, where each node is an object representing a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text).
Characteristics of the DOM:
Direct Manipulation: Changes to the DOM are immediately reflected in the browser.
Performance Impact: Direct manipulation of the DOM can be slow and costly, especially when dealing with large or complex documents.
Synchronous Updates: Changes to the DOM can cause synchronous reflows and repaints, affecting the performance and user experience.
Virtual DOM : What is the Virtual DOM? The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is used by libraries like React to manage and update the UI efficiently. The Virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.
Characteristics of the Virtual DOM:
Efficient Updates: The Virtual DOM allows for efficient updates by comparing the current version with the previous version and identifying the minimal set of changes needed.
Batch Updates: Changes to the Virtual DOM are batched and then applied to the real DOM in a single operation, minimizing performance impact.
Asynchronous Updates: Updates to the real DOM are performed asynchronously, reducing the risk of blocking the main thread.
Advantages of Virtual DOM over DOM
Performance:
The Virtual DOM reduces the performance impact of direct DOM manipulation by batching updates and applying them efficiently.
The diffing algorithm identifies the minimal set of changes needed, reducing the number of operations on the real DOM.
Efficiency:
With the Virtual DOM, only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
This selective updating ensures a smoother and faster user experience.
Consistency:
The Virtual DOM provides a consistent and predictable way to manage updates, reducing the risk of bugs and errors.
It ensures that the UI stays in sync with the application's state, improving reliability.
Developer Productivity:
The Virtual DOM abstracts away the complexities of direct DOM manipulation, allowing developers to focus on building the application logic.
It simplifies the development process by providing a more intuitive and declarative way to describe the UI.
Summary
DOM: Represents the page as a hierarchical tree structure, allowing direct manipulation of the document.
Virtual DOM: A lightweight, in-memory representation of the DOM that enables efficient and performant updates through batching and asynchronous operations.
Overall, the Virtual DOM enhances performance, efficiency, and developer productivity, making it a key feature in modern UI libraries like React.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
give me more about reactjs ? Virtual DOM ? how it was designed and developed ? on what algorithm react js was designed and developed ?
Sure! Let's dive deeper into ReactJS, its Virtual DOM, and the algorithm behind it.
ReactJS and Virtual DOM : ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. One of its key features is the Virtual DOM, which significantly enhances the performance of web applications.
What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. Instead of interacting directly with the real DOM, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance, React creates a virtual representation of the UI components. This virtual representation is a lightweight JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.
How the Virtual DOM Works
Initial Rendering: When the app starts, the entire UI is represented as a Virtual DOM. React elements are created and rendered into the virtual structure.
State and Props Changes: As the states and props change in the app, React re-renders the affected components in the Virtual DOM. These changes do not immediately impact the real DOM.
Comparison Using Diff Algorithm: React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the current version of the Virtual DOM with the previous version. This process identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two versions.
Reconciliation Process: Based on the differences identified, React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM. Only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This selective updating is quick and performant.
Update to the Real DOM: Finally, React applies the necessary changes to the real DOM. This might involve adding, removing, or updating elements based on the differences detected.
Algorithm Behind ReactJS
React's reconciliation algorithm, also known as the diffing algorithm, is designed to efficiently update the UI by minimizing the number of operations required to transform one tree of elements into another.
Key Concepts of the Diffing Algorithm
Elements of Different Types: Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. This ensures that the UI is accurately updated.
DOM Elements of the Same Type: When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes.
Component Instances: React uses a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.
These assumptions help React efficiently update the UI while maintaining high performance.
Design and Development of ReactJS : ReactJS was designed and developed by Facebook to address the challenges of building complex and dynamic user interfaces. The key goals were to improve performance, enhance developer productivity, and create a more maintainable codebase. The introduction of the Virtual DOM and the reconciliation algorithm were pivotal in achieving these goals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
React - What is Diffing Algorithm?
Diffing Algorithm in React JS differentiates the updated and previous DOM of the application. DOM stores the components of a website in a tree structure. React uses virtual DOM which is a lightweight version of the DOM. The only difference is the ability to write the screen like the real DOM, in fact, a new virtual DOM is created after every re-render.

Why is the Diffing Algorithm Important?
Manipulating the DOM is one of the most performance-intensive operations in web development. Updating the entire DOM every time there’s a change would significantly slow down applications. The diffing algorithm ensures that only the minimum required updates are made, leading to:

Improved performance: By limiting DOM manipulations, the application runs faster.
Smooth user experience: Users experience fewer lags, even in dynamic applications.
Optimized rendering: React can handle frequent updates in real-time without performance bottlenecks.
How Diffing Algorithm Works?
First, the content is rendered on the webpage and the DOM tree is created.
On change in any content due to user interaction or change in data from API, React works on observable patterns, hence, whenever there is a change in the state, it updates the nodes in the virtual DOM
In reconciliation the old tree is compared to the newest version to determine the number of changes needed for updation.
After determining the changes a set of optimized and minimal instruction is created to implement on the real DOM.
These changes are then implemented and only content that changed is re-rendered on the web pages.
Assumption for Diffing Algorithm
React uses a heuristic algorithm called the Diffing algorithm for reconciliation based on these assumptions:

Elements of different types will produce different trees
We can set which elements are static and do not need to be checked.
React checks the root elements for changes and the updates depend on the types of the root elements,

Element in different types: Whenever the type of the element changes in the root, react will scrap the old tree and build a new one i.e a full rebuild of the tree.
Elements of the same type: When the type of changed element is the same, React then checks for attributes of both versions and then only updates the node which has changes without any changes in the tree. The component will be updated in the next lifecycle call.

Note: This is the reason why we should always use unique keys in the elements so that it will be easy for React to determine changes in the elements.

Advantages of Diffing Algorithm
It enables efficient updates and reduce the work need to reflect the changes
It enhances the performance by updating only the required components/ nodes.
Results in faster response while change by reducing the unwanted and unnecessary re-renderings.
Limitations of the Diffing Algorithm
While the diffing algorithm is highly efficient, there are some cases where improper use can lead to performance issues

Missing or duplicate keys: Not providing unique keys for list items can result in unnecessary re-renders.
Complex nested structures: In deeply nested components, the diffing process may take longer, although it is still optimized compared to manual DOM manipulation.

ReactJS State
Last Updated : 12 Apr, 2025
In React, the state refers to an object that holds information about a component's current situation. This information can change over time, typically as a result of user actions or data fetching, and when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated UI.

Whenever state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data. This enables you to build dynamic UIs that respond to user interactions.

Syntax

const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
In this syntax

state: The current state value.
setState: A function that is used to update the state.
initialState: The initial value that the state will hold when the component is first rendered.
Creating State Object
Creating a state in React is essential to building dynamic and interactive components. We can create a state object within the constructor of the class component.


import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            brand: 'Ford', // Example property in the state
        };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>My Car</h1>
                {/* Other component content */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default MyComponent;
The MyComponent class extends React.Component, and inside the constructor, it initializes the component's state with a brand property set to 'Ford'.
The render() method returns JSX that displays an <h1> heading with the text "My Car" and renders the component's content.
Updating State in React
We are using the ES6 thick arrow function format to take the previous state and props of the component as parameters and are updating the counter. The same can be written using the default functional way as follows.  


// Filename - index.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            count: 0,
        };
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
            count: prevState.count + 1,
        }));
    };

    decrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
            count: prevState.count - 1,
        }));
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>
                    The current count is :{" "}
                    {this.state.count}
                </h1>
                <button onClick={this.increment}>
                    Increase
                </button>
                <button onClick={this.decrement}>
                    Decrease
                </button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById("root")
);
root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
Output


ReactJS State

Key Features of State in React
Encapsulation of Data: Each React component has its own state, and the state data is encapsulated within the component. This means that state is not shared across components unless explicitly passed via props.
Reactivity and Re-rendering: When state changes, React automatically triggers a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state in the UI. React ensures that only the parts of the UI that depend on the state are re-rendered, improving performance.
Mutable Within the Component: State is mutable, meaning you can change it using the setState() method (in class components) or the state-updating function returned by useState() (in functional components). However, you should not directly mutate the state (e.g., this.state.count = 5), as this can lead to unexpected behavior.
Best Practices for Managing State in React
Do Not Directly Modify State: Avoid directly modifying the state. Instead, use setState() or the state-updating function from useState() to ensure proper reactivity.
Use Functional Updates for Previous State: If the new state depends on the previous state, use a functional update to avoid potential issues with state changes.
Lift State Up When Necessary: In React, state should be lifted up to the nearest common ancestor if two components need to share the same state. This makes it easier to manage state at a higher level and pass it down via props.
Use Multiple State Variables: You don’t have to store all your state in a single object. React allows you to use multiple useState() calls in a single component. This can improve readability and maintainability by keeping state values grouped logically.
State vs Props
While both state and props store data in React, they serve different purposes:

State: Managed within the component, mutable, and used to store dynamic data that changes over time.
Props: Passed from a parent component to a child component, immutable, and used to share data between components.
State can change over time and cause re-renders, whereas props are used to pass data from one component to another but are not directly modified by the component receiving them.

When to Use State in React
You should use state in React whenever:

You need to store dynamic data that changes over time.
The component should re-render when the state changes, reflecting updates in the UI.
You need to manage user input, form data, or API responses.
However, if the data does not change over time, it should be handled via props instead of state.

Conclusion
State is an essential concept in React that allows components to maintain dynamic data and re-render themselves when necessary. Whether you're using class components with this.setState() or functional components with the useState() hook, managing state effectively is key to building interactive React applications.

Implementing State in React Components
Last Updated : 11 Jul, 2025
In React State is an object that holds some information which can be changed overtime. Whenever a State is updated it triggers re-rendering of the component. In React components State can be implemented by default in class components and in functional components we have to implement state using hooks.

Approaches To Implementing State in React
Implementing State Using this.state object
Implementing State using useState hook:
Conclusion:
Approaches To Implementing State in React
There are two ways to implement state in React Components based upon the type of component

Using the this.state object (Class Component)
Using the useState hook (Functional Components)
Implementing State Using this.state object
Create a class component by extending Component class
Inside the constructor call the parent constructor using super() method
Initialize state using the this.state object
Pass the values in key-value pair
You can update this state using the this.setState method
To access the state we use JSX syntax and access its value
Implement State using this.state Example :
This example creates a counter in react by implementing state using the above mentioned approach


import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {
            count: 0,
        };
        this.increase = this.increase.bind(this);
    }

    increase() {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ margin: "50px" }}>
                <h1>Welcome to Geeks for Geeks </h1>
                <h3>Counter App using Class Component : </h3>
                <h2> {this.state.count}</h2>
                <button onClick={this.increase}> Add</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
Output:

gfg

Implementing State using useState hook:
Import the useState hook from react
Create a functional component
Create a state object using useState hook
The second parameter in useState hook is used to update the state
The state can be accessed using the JSX syntax
Implement state using react hooks Example:
This example creates a counter by implementing state using the above mentioned approach


import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increase = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div style={{ margin: '50px' }}>
            <h1>Welcome to Geeks for Geeks </h1>
            <h3>Counter App using Functional Component : </h3>
            <h2>{count}</h2>
            <button onClick={increase}>Add</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App;
Output:



Conclusion:
States can be implemented in React by both functional and class components but to implement state in functional component we have to import the useState hook but state can be implemented directly in class component using the this.state object. States are useful as they are mutable unlike props and can helps us to create dynamic and interactive interfaces
